<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ngozi Uloka, and I am a dedicated professional with a strong foundation in statistics and a growing passion for technology. I graduated from the University of Ilorin with a degree in Statistics and built valuable experience in administrative and customer service roles. My career journey began at Globacom Nigeria as a call center agent, followed by a role at Ecobank Nigeria as a contact center agent. Later, I served as a front desk and administrative officer at Charitos BO Hospital, where I honed my interpersonal and organizational skills.</p>

<p>In 2022, I transitioned into the tech industry, embarking on a self-learning journey that fueled my curiosity and passion for software development. I enrolled in ALX Africa's rigorous software engineering program and subsequently joined TIIDELab, earning certification as a junior frontend developer. More recently, I ventured into blockchain and web3 technologies, participating in the Web3Bridge program to deepen my understanding of decentralized systems and their applications. These experiences have equipped me with a versatile skill set and the determination to excel in the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>

<p>Currently, I am reinforcing my web development skills by taking Angela Yu's Complete Web Development Course. This course is helping me build confidence and proficiency in creating robust web applications. As part of my journey, I am working on assignments like this webpage, which reflect my growth and commitment to becoming a well-rounded web developer ready to tackle real-world challenges.</p>
