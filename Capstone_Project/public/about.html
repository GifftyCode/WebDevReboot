<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to my space! My name is Ngozi Uloka, a graduate of the University of
  Ilorin, where I earned my degree in Statistics. My academic journey equipped

  for a versatile and adaptive career.

  In 2022, I decided to take a bold step toward my passion for technology. I
  embarked on a journey of self-learning, immersing myself in coding and
  software development. I joined ALX Africa, where I completed a rigorous
  software engineering program, gaining foundational knowledge and practical
  experience. Building on this, I joined TIIDELab, earning a certification as a
  junior frontend developer and working on hands-on projects that enhanced my
  proficiency in building responsive and dynamic web applications. More
  recently, I ventured into the exciting world of blockchain and Web3
  technologies through Web3Bridge, where I began exploring decentralized
  systems, smart contracts, and the future of the internet.

  My ultimate goal is to blend my analytical background, customer-oriented
  mindset, and technical expertise to create meaningful solutions that address
  real-world challenges. Whether itâ€™s building user-friendly web applications or
  contributing to innovative blockchain projects, I am dedicated to continuous
  growth and impactful contributions to the tech ecosystem. Thank you for taking
  the time to learn more about me. I look forward to connecting and
  collaborating with individuals and organizations who share my passion for
  technology and innovation.
